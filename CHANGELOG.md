# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Fixed

- Streamed tracks behave like downloaded ones again around the edges.
  A reopened app showed the restored track with a full bar and a total of
  0:00; Previous could only ever restart the song — from the wrong place —
  and never reach the previous track; the end of a streamed queue didn't
  park back at the start; and repeat modes could stop playback or wrap to
  the first track paused. One family of causes: the seeked/restored stream
  (a shorter file starting mid-track) was advertised with a guessed length
  that invited range requests the server answers with 416, the player's own
  duration never arrives for a live transcode, a queue edit could land
  after the seek that should follow it, and a seek during rebuffering read
  "paused" and never resumed. All are fixed and were verified against a
  real Navidrome on the emulator; none of this touched downloads, which is
  why it went unseen so long.

### Changed

- Light's SDK now comes in as the `light-sdk` submodule, pinned to upstream
  and pulled pristine; every change Amp makes to it travels as a patch file in
  `light-sdk-patch/` that the build applies by itself. Same code, honest
  shape — and an SDK update becomes a checkout instead of archaeology.
- SDK updated 0.0.12 → 0.1.1. Nothing here uses the new pieces yet, but they
  are the ones the next releases will build on: official background audio
  (`detached-audio`), an NFC reader API, `openDialer`. One behavioural edge
  moved: audio-focus handling now rides ExoPlayer's built-in path (upstream's
  change), so ducking and transient-loss resume come from Media3 rather than
  the SDK's old helper — worth an ear during phone-call and navigation-prompt
  interruptions.

## 0.5.0

### Fixed

- Data modes now hold everywhere. Downloads and cover fetches never run on
  metered data (cellular, or a phone-hotspot Wi-Fi).
- The network check reads the connection the phone is actually using, through
  the SDK's new ConnectivityManager hooks (light-sdk #163). A Wi-Fi that had
  lost internet used to still count as Wi-Fi while every byte rode cellular.
- The whole UI now sizes itself from the panel's real width, the way the
  phone's own tools do. Changing Android's "smallest width" (density) setting
  used to shrink every control and font while other apps stayed put; now Amp
  renders the same pixels at any setting, and scales properly on any future
  panel.

### Changed

- Low Data is now the default for new installs. It was Wi-Fi Only — which,
  now that Wi-Fi Only really means no network, would have left a first
  sign-in over cellular with nothing synced and no visible reason.


## 0.4.1

### Fixed

- Playing to the end of a queue closed the app, and reopening put you back at
  the same spot to do it again. Present since 0.3.0.

## 0.4.0

The first launch trims the artwork cache to 200 MB in the background; covers
come back as you browse.

### Added

- Start Song Radio, in every song's menu, on Navidrome, Plex and Jellyfin.
  Started from the playing song, it keeps the song and replaces what follows.
- Save Queue as Playlist, in the + menu.
- Hold the top-right button on any page, or on the player, to open Settings.
- Tap Random again in a sort menu for a new shuffle. The sort page says what a
  second tap does.
- Delete one server's downloads from the Offline page.
- An artist's popular songs are kept for a week and shown offline.

### Changed

- Settings is five pages: Appearance, Sources, Data, Offline and About.
  Streaming quality is under Data; auto-download and download quality are under
  Offline. A server's page keeps Connection, Player Name, Shown on Sources, Sync
  Now and Log Out.
- "Offline Mode" is now "Auto-Download".
- Album pages put track numbers in a gutter that fits three digits, and show the
  artist line only where the tracks' artists differ. The corner button opens the
  album's own menu, not a sort menu. Playlists likewise.
- The player's header is the same bar as everywhere else.
- Covers are fetched at 1080px.
- The "Plays" sort is "Frequently Played". Rating is offered only where the
  server can rate.
- Hide Artist Photos is on by default.

### Fixed

- Local Music said it had no access on phones where the permission was granted,
  and Sync Now led back to Allow Music Access.
- Switching from a cast back to This Device started the song over. It now
  picks up where the speaker was.
- While casting, dragging to the end of a song waited, then restarted it. It
  goes to the next song.
- Seeking while casting replayed the song from the top before jumping. It seeks
  in place.
- The clock flashed the previous song's time on Next while casting.
- A source switched during a sync could write one server's albums into
  another's library, where they showed in every library. Fixed, and the stray
  rows are removed on the next sync.
- Everything and Favorites never auto-downloaded playlist songs.
- Delete All Downloads emptied only the active source.
- The artwork cache grew without limit — 3 GB on one phone — keeping a copy of
  each cover per song. One per album now, 200 MB at most; the covers of
  downloaded albums are always kept.

### Removed

- The Monochrome Artwork setting. Color follows the artwork switch.

## 0.3.1

### Fixed

- Long tracks took minutes to start. A 29-minute track needed 68 seconds; the
  same 124-minute one now starts in under a second.
- Library tabs lost their place when you switched away and back.

### Added

- Album track rows show the length under the performer.

### Changed

- Full-screen artwork opens with the controls out of the way when you go to it;
  opening the player still brings them back.
- No artist pictures on the phone's own library, which has none to show.
- The Source row is hidden when there is one source with one library.

## 0.3.0

**Needs one online sync after updating.** Downloads are safe; the Downloads page
looks empty until the sync finishes.

### Fixed

- Artists listed track performers, so every "feat." guest became its own artist.
  Now album artists.
- Switching library while offline emptied the library.
- Playlists, Artists and Albums did nothing when pressed from an album page.
- The queue ended parked on the last song. It now returns to the first, stopped.
- Each source was measured against the size limit separately.
- The size limit now counts what is already downloaded.

### Added

- Search on the page you're in, results narrowing as you type.
- Genre and Composer filters on Albums and Songs.
- Offline browsing — every list shows what you can play.
- The Downloads page lists every library and source. Read-only.
- Liked is a single switch.
- The queue header says "3 of 12".
- Album pages show who plays on each song, not its length.
- Pressing the current tab returns to the top of it.

### Changed

- The expanded tab bar is the default again. The setting is now "Simplified
  Library View"; existing installs keep their layout.
- One storage limit for the whole app, in Settings.
- The bottom bar's fifth button is the player; search moved to the header.
- Every library stays cached, so switching is instant and works offline.

### Removed

- The Compilations page.
- The Genres and Composers pages, now filters.
- The More page.
- Each source's separate Downloads page.
- The per-source download library setting, and the Include Lyrics toggle.
