/**
 * The keyboard as the phone has it set — swipe typing, key animation, the
 * voice key — asked of LightOS when a keyboard appears.
 *
 * The keyboard is a library every tool ships a copy of; the settings for it are
 * the phone's, and only LightOS knows them. Amp used to hand every keyboard the
 * SDK's fixed defaults, so a phone with swipe typing on typed without it here.
 * The SDK's own tools ask through `rememberKeyboardOptions`, which asks again
 * on every recomposition — on the search page that would be a call per
 * keystroke — so this asks once per keyboard and keeps the answer. LightOS not
 * answering, an older build or a hiccup, leaves the defaults in place, which is
 * exactly what the keyboard showed before.
 *
 * **No emoji, anywhere in Amp.** The phone's emoji set is a messaging
 * preference, and nothing typed here is a message: a search, a server address,
 * a playlist name, a password. The library draws the emoji key only when it is
 * handed some, and puts a spacer in its place otherwise — so an empty set is
 * the keyboard's own no-emoji state, not a layout of ours.
 *
 * [swipe] pins swipe typing regardless of the setting. The password screen
 * turns it off: its keyboard masks what is typed and has no words to offer, so
 * a swiped word would be silently dropped — see MaskedKeyboardCallback.
