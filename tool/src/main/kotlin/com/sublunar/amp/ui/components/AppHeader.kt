 * very style it will be drawn in ([appTextStyle]) — measuring in a near-enough
 * style is answering the question about a different string — and in the room
 * actually left after whatever shares the slot.
 *
 * Measured rather than drawn-then-corrected: laying it out large, noticing the
 * overflow and recomposing smaller would show one frame of the wrong size on
