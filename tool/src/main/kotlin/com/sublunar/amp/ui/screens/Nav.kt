 * What the page being opened should have underneath it — where back leads.

 * library page means saying what is above it. Walking down a tab already
 * answers that: the page you are standing on *is* the parent, and a push is the
 * whole of it. A jump from outside the library — the player's menu, the queue,
 * a search result — has nothing above it worth returning to, so the walk that
 * would have reached the page is laid down first: unwind to the library, choose
 * the tab whose hierarchy the page belongs to, push the ancestors in order.
 * Back then walks that hierarchy for free, the tab bar stays lit the whole way
 * down, and the last step out lands on a tab root with no back button — which is
 * what a parent page is.
 *
 * Pushing a jump on top of wherever you happened to be gives back nothing
 * sensible to do: from Now Playing → Go to Album, backing out led to the artist,
 * and backing out of *that* returned to the album, because the album was still
 * underneath it on the stack.
 *
 * Which of the two applies is the caller's to name rather than something to
 * infer here. Neither rule is safe as a blanket one: laying the ancestors down
 * is right from a tab list and wrong from a genre, a compilation or a playlist,
 * because those are real parents and unwinding to a tab root throws them away.
