/**
 * The LP3's own keyboard, against the bottom of the search page.
 *
 * The SDK hosts this inside [com.thelightphone.sdk.ui.LightTextInputEditor],
 * which is a whole screen: the text sits at the top with nothing below it, which
 * is no use to a search that has to show its results narrowing as you type. The
 * keyboard itself is a composable though, and the view model that drives it is
 * public — so the page keeps its own layout and simply places the keyboard last.
 *
 * Nothing in the SDK is patched or worked around to do this. The one thing not
 * reused is `TextInputKeyboardCallback`, which is `internal`, so
 * [SearchKeyboardCallback] below implements the same public interface instead.
