/**
 * Where a list was scrolled to, remembered across a trip to another screen.
 *
 * The SDK composes only the top of the back stack, so opening the long-press
 * sheet tears down the list underneath it and a plain `rememberLazyListState`
 * comes back at row one — halfway down eight thousand songs, that's the whole
 * scroll lost to a single tap.
 *
 * Positions are stored in *content* coordinates, with the header rows above the
 * list (Liked / Shuffle / Play) subtracted out. A list that drops those rows on
 * entering selection mode therefore still comes back to the same song rather
 * than three rows off.
