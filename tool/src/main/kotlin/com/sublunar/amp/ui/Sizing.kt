 * How the canvas maps onto the panel this is drawing on.

 * A design pixel is a fraction of the window's width, not a dp. The sizes in the
 * app were measured on the LP3 in pixels and used to be turned into dp by
 * assuming the LP3's 3× density — which held until someone changed it:
 * Android's "smallest width" setting lowers the density, every dp becomes fewer
 * pixels, and the app shrank on a panel that hadn't. Light's own components
 * size from the screen's width (`gridUnitsAsDp`), so density cancels out and
 * they don't move; this does the same, in the unit the app is already written
 * in.
 *
 * Each size rounds to a whole pixel of the panel. On the LP3 the factor is
 * exactly 1 and nothing moves; elsewhere a 3px hairline stays a 3px hairline
 * rather than a 2.9px one the renderer smears across four.
