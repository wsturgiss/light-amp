/**
 * The page's own menu: where its music comes from, and the three ways of
 * looking at it.
 *
 * One place for all of them. View, sort and filter used to be spread across a
 * title tap, a heart in a menu's corner and a section folded into the sort
 * list — three different gestures, none of which said what it was currently
 * set to without being opened. Here each states its value on its own line.
 *
 * Every row shows whether or not the page can change it. A song list has one
 * layout and a record has one order, and saying so is more use than a row that
 * silently isn't there: an absent row reads as a missing feature, where "View:
 * List" reads as the answer. Those rows don't take a press — see [TextRow].
