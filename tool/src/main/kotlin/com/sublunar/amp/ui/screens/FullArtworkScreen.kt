/**
 * An album's cover at full width, from its own page.
 *
 * Whole rather than cropped to a square, hanging from the header's bottom edge,
 * with nothing playing behind it: no seek line, no play button, just which
 * record this is and the way back. Tapping a sleeve on the album page is a
 * request to look at it, not to start it.
 *
 * Reads the album from the library rather than taking a copy, so a sync that
 * corrects a title changes it here too.
