 * arrow beside the selected option shows which direction is in effect when the
 * menu is reopened; Random gets no arrow, because a shuffle has no direction.
 *
 * The label up top says what the second tap does. The gesture is invisible
 * otherwise — nothing about a selected row suggests it still answers a tap —
 * and it is the same idiom the connection form uses for its own hidden verb
 * ("Tap a field to change it").
 *
 * Closing lands wherever the menu was opened from — the list, for the title
 * tap, or More, which is a panel of modifiers you may well want to set two of
