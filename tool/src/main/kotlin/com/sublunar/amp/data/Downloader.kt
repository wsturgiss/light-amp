 * the phone's own files. What holds downloads back is the data mode, the user's
 * own pause, and — per source, never for everyone — a server that has stopped
 * answering or a library mid-sync. See [DownloadQueue] for the order.
 *
 * One worker at a time, deliberately — and measured, not assumed. Navidrome
 * transcodes on demand, and that encode is the ceiling: against the real library a
 * single stream and three concurrent streams both delivered **0.5 MB/s in total**,
 * except that with three nothing finished inside 92s while one worker completed
 * four tracks. Concurrency buys no bandwidth here and costs completion latency, so
 * don't reach for it again without re-measuring the aggregate. (Bursts of ~4 MB/s
 * do happen — those are tracks already sitting in the server's transcode cache.)
 * That measurement was one server; two servers would be two transcoders, but
 * also one phone's downlink, so the same rule stands until someone measures it.
