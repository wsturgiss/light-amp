/**
 * The other half of a Companion subscription: somewhere for a player to push
 * its timeline to.
 *
 * Plex's own model is push, not poll — a controller subscribes and the player
 * sends its state as it changes. That needs the controller to be reachable,
 * which is all this is: a small HTTP server that accepts a timeline, answers
 * 200, and hands the body on. It replaces asking a player the same question
 * every second, which is chatty, blocks the player's single connection while
 * it happens, and tells us nothing between beats.
 *
 * Polling remains the fallback in [com.sublunar.amp.playback.PlaybackController]:
 * a player that won't subscribe, or a network that won't route back here, must
 * still work.
