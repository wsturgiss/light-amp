/**
 * The phone's own music: the files the Light Music app plays, read straight off
 * the filesystem.
 *
 * There is no MediaStore here — `android.content` is a blocked import for a
 * tool, so the library can't be queried the usual way. What a tool *can* do is
 * hold `READ_MEDIA_AUDIO` (it's on the SDK's allowed list) and walk the shared
 * music folder with `java.io`, reading tags with [MediaMetadataRetriever], which
 * takes a plain path and needs no context. That is exactly what this does.
 *
 * Ids are the file's own path behind [ID_PREFIX], so they're stable across
 * rescans without a database of their own, and playback can turn any track back
 * into a file without a lookup.
