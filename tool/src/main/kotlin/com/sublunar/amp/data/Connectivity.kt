/**
 * What the connection costs, from the SDK's ConnectivityManager hooks.
 *
 * This replaces an interface-list heuristic — "a wlan interface with an
 * address means Wi-Fi" — that could be lied to: Android moves traffic to
 * cellular when a Wi-Fi link stops validating, and the interface keeps its
 * address while the bytes ride LTE. That is how a heavy data day happens with
 * every setting right. The SDK's [com.thelightphone.sdk.LightConnectivity]
 * (upstream #163/#166) reads the *active* network, so the answer here is about
 * the route the bytes will actually take — and the callback makes changes land
 * at once rather than on a five-second poll.
 *
 * Gates ask about *metered-ness*, not "is it Wi-Fi": a phone-hotspot Wi-Fi is
 * metered and is treated as the cellular it rides on. The settings keep saying
 * "Wi-Fi", because that is the phone in most hands.
