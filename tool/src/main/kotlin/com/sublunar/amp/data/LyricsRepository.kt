/**
 * Where lyrics come from, and which copy wins.
 *
 * Navidrome only returns timed lyrics when the file itself carries them, and this
 * library's files mostly don't — so `getLyricsBySongId` answers with plain text
 * and there is nothing for the karaoke view to highlight. The old React Native
 * app solved this by falling back to lrclib.net for timed lyrics; this is the
 * same strategy, in the same order.
 *
 * Synced always wins, whichever side it comes from. lrclib is only asked when the
 * server didn't already provide timed lyrics, so the common case costs no extra
 * request.
