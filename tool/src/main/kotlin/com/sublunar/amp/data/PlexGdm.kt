/**
 * Plex's own LAN discovery — GDM — for finding players on this network.
 *
 * The way Plex's own controllers find a player, and the reason it is here: the
 * account's device list at plex.tv is not a reliable census. It drops a device
 * that sleeps, and an Apple TV woken up and playing music can be missing from
 * it entirely while sitting on the same Wi-Fi, ready. Asking the network
 * settles that without asking anyone's opinion.
 *
 * A broadcast `M-SEARCH` to port 32412 and each player answers, unicast, with
 * a few HTTP-shaped headers naming itself. Replies come back to our own
 * ephemeral port, so this needs no multicast lock and no WifiManager — the
 * same reason the SSDP discovery in `DlnaCast` doesn't.
