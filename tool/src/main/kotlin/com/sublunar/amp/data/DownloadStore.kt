/**
 * The on-disk half of offline playback: downloaded audio under the tool's private
 * files directory, plus the storage arithmetic the settings UI needs.
 *
 * A folder per source, because two servers can hand out the same track id for
 * different music — and because removing a source has to be able to take its
 * audio with it without touching anyone else's. Every call names the source it
 * means: the downloader fetches for every source at once, whichever is being
 * browsed, so there is no "current" folder for it to default to.
 *
 * Plain [File] work — the plugin sandbox allows `java.io` and `android.os.StatFs`,
 * so none of this needs SDK support.

     * TEMPORARY MIGRATION — DELETE BEFORE SUBMITTING THE TOOL FOR COMMUNITY
     * REVIEW.
     *
     * ## What this is
     *
     * Index every mp3 on disk that lacks one — see [Mp3VbrIndex] for what an
     * index is and why a streamed mp3 arrives without one. Amp downloaded mp3s
     * without writing that index until 2026-09-03. This repairs the files
     * already on people's phones, once, so that a fix shipped in an update does
     * not require re-fetching a library to take effect.
     *
     * ## Why it is temporary
     *
     * Everything downloaded since that date is indexed as it lands, by the call
     * in [Downloader]'s download loop. That is the real mechanism and it is
     * permanent. This walk exists only for files that predate it, so it is
     * dead weight the moment those files are gone — and it is not free: it
     * reads the first frame of every downloaded mp3 in every source's folder,
     * which for a large offline library is tens of megabytes of disk at
     * startup to discover there is nothing to do. It is gated to run once per
     * install ([AppSettings.mp3IndexRepairNeeded]) so that cost is paid once,
     * but the code should not outlive the installs that need it.
     *
     * ## How to remove it (all of it)
     *
     * 1. This function.
     * 2. Its caller in `App.boot` — the `scope.launch(Dispatchers.IO)` block
     *    marked TEMPORARY, which claims the flag and calls this.
     * 3. [AppSettings.mp3IndexRepairNeeded], [AppSettings.markMp3IndexRepaired]
     *    and their `MP3_INDEX_REPAIRED` key.
     *
     * Keep [Mp3VbrIndex] itself and the call in [Downloader]. Those are not
     * part of this migration — without them, every mp3 downloaded from a
     * server that transcodes as a stream goes back to reporting a length that
     * can be wrong by a factor of seven, playing silence past its end, and
     * seeking to the wrong place.
     *
     * ## When it is safe to remove
     *
     * When it is reasonable to expect that anyone still using downloads made
     * before 2026-09-03 has launched a version carrying this at least once.
     * Nothing breaks for a straggler who has not: their old files keep the
     * wrong duration until re-downloaded, which is the state they were already
     * in. No data is lost either way.
     *
     * ## One detail, if you are reading this to change it
     *
     * The downloads table's `bytes` for a repaired file is left as it was, a
     * few hundred bytes short of the truth. That is deliberate: the storage
     * figure the user sees is read off the disk rather than the table, and the
     * table lives in one source's database while this covers every source.
