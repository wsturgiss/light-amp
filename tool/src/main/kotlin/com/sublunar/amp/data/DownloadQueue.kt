 *
 * Two lanes, drained in order: what the user asked for, then what a mode
 * decided to fetch on their behalf. Without the split, tapping Download on an
 * album while "Download everything" was working through a ten-thousand-track
 * library put that album ten thousand tracks back. A manual pick also
 * *promotes* a track already waiting in the automatic lane rather than
 * queueing it twice.
 *
 * Entries are keyed by source *and* track: two servers can hand out the same
 * id for different music, and every source's downloads share this one queue
 * whichever of them is being browsed. [next] takes a predicate for that
 * reason — a source whose server has stopped answering, or whose library is
 * mid-sync, is skipped rather than parking everyone else's downloads behind
 * it.
