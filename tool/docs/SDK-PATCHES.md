# SDK changes

Amp needs some changes to `sdk/client` in Light's repository. They fall into
two groups, and the difference matters.

**Additions** (§1–9) are small, self-contained and would be reasonable in the SDK
as it stands. Every one is marked in the source with
`SDK PATCH (additive, upstreamable)`.

**Workarounds** (§10–14) exist only because there is no supported route. Every one
is marked `SPIKE` or `TEMPORARY`, carries revert instructions in its own comment,
and must come out before a tool is submitted. What each is standing in for is
explained in [SDK-GAPS.md](SDK-GAPS.md).

Since the submodule restructure, every change here also exists as a literal
patch file in [`light-sdk-patch/`](../../light-sdk-patch/) at the repo root;
the build applies the set to the pristine `light-sdk` submodule automatically.
The patch files are the mechanical truth — this document is the narrative:
what each change is for, and how to revert it.

To find them all in a checkout:

```bash
grep -rn "SDK PATCH\|SPIKE\|TEMPORARY" light-sdk/sdk tool/src
```

### Counted, not remembered

This list undercounted for a while: it named three of the additions to
`LightAudioPlayer` and missed eleven more, which made the whole patch set look
about half its real size. Anyone planning to drop the patches — which is what
submitting a tool means — would have planned against the wrong number.

The way to check, rather than trust the prose, is to compare the public surface
against upstream and confirm nothing on any upstream branch already provides it:

```bash
git fetch upstream
diff <(grep -oE "^\s{4}(fun|val|var|suspend fun) [a-zA-Z]+" \
        sdk/client/src/main/kotlin/com/thelightphone/sdk/audio/LightAudioPlayer.kt | sort -u) \
     <(git show upstream/main:sdk/client/src/main/kotlin/com/thelightphone/sdk/audio/LightAudioPlayer.kt \
        | grep -oE "^\s{4}(fun|val|var|suspend fun) [a-zA-Z]+" | sort -u)
```

"Differs from `upstream/main`" is not the same as "we wrote it" — upstream moves,
and this copy is pinned. A member is ours only if no upstream branch has it:

```bash
git branch -r --list 'upstream/*' | tr -d ' ' \
  | xargs -I{} git grep -l "fun replaceRange" {} -- '*/LightAudioPlayer.kt'
```

Last counted 2026-08-18 against `upstream/main` at `522f94d`.

## Additions

### 1. `LightScreen.popToRoot()` / `LightActivity.popToRoot()`

Unwind to the initial screen. A tool with a tab bar visible on nested screens
needs it — `goBack()` only unwinds one level.

Two details matter in the implementation:

- Publish `currentScreen` **once**, after the loop. Assigning it per iteration
  makes every screen on the way down the current one for a frame, and since it
  drives composition each gets drawn on its way out — unwinding four screens
  flashes four pages past the user.
- Only the visible screen gets `notifyWillHide()`; the rest were never shown.

### 2. `LightAudioPlayer.onPlaybackError`

Forward Media3's `onPlayerError` to a tool-settable callback. Without it a
failed stream is indistinguishable from a pause, and an offline-capable player
can't fall back to a downloaded copy.

The `PlaybackException` itself is worth passing, not just the fact of an error:
its `errorCode` separates "the server answered with an error status" from "the
server never answered", which are different situations. Treating both as
"offline" takes a whole library down to downloads-only over one bad URL.

### 3. `LightAudioPlayer.replaceRange(fromIndex, toIndex, items)`

Swap a range of the queue in one operation, leaving an item outside the range
playing. Reordering by repeated `moveItem` is a timeline update per move, and a
few hundred of those with a media session attached rebuilds the legacy queue —
artwork and all — each time, until the process runs out of memory.

Also the right way to re-request a stream at a new offset: removing and
re-adding the playing item moves the player's current index twice, which any
listener reads as a track change.

### 4. The rest of `LightAudioPlayer`

Eleven more members, all additive, none present on any upstream branch. They are
grouped here rather than given a section each because they are one thing: the
player the SDK ships can start a queue and move through it, and a music tool also
has to *edit* that queue, restore it, and be driven by the phone's own controls.

| Member | Why a music tool needs it |
|---|---|
| `addItems`, `addItemAt` | Play Next and Add to Queue. Rebuilding the queue to append to it loses the playing item's position. |
| `removeItem`, `moveItem` | The queue editor — remove a track, drag one up. |
| `seekToIndex` | Tapping a row in the queue. |
| `setMediaQueueAt(items, index, positionMs)` | Restoring a saved queue mid-track. The position has to go in at prepare time: `seekTo` clamps to a duration that isn't known yet, so it lands on 0. |
| `deviceVolume`, `setSystemVolume` | The hardware rocker, which a tool has to service itself while casting — see `PlaybackController.handleVolumeKey`. |
| `repeatMode` | Repeat off / all / one. |
| `pauseAtEndOfMediaItems` | Stopping cleanly at the end of a track rather than rolling into the next. |
| `skipSilence` | Gapless-ish playback of albums recorded without gaps. |

None of them is novel — every one is a `Player` method or property that media3
already exposes and the SDK does not forward. That is also why they would survive
the detached-audio migration: upstream's detached player holds a `Player`, and
both `ExoPlayer` and `MediaController` implement it. See SDK-GAPS.md.

### 5. `buildDatabase` — `fallbackToDestructiveMigration`

A tool can't reach Room except through this helper (`android.content.Context` is
a blocked import), so it can't register migrations or a fallback. Without one,
shipping any schema change crashes every existing install on launch. Recreating
the tables is the right default: a tool's Room database is a rebuildable cache of
server state, not the system of record.

### 6. Splash icon centring

`sdk/client/src/main/res/drawable/loading_text_icon.xml` — the "loading…"
glyphs sit at y≈96 in a 240-unit viewport whose centre is 120, so the word
renders ~88px above centre on a 1240px panel (measured). The paths are wrapped
in `<group android:translateY="24.5">`; the paths themselves are untouched, so
reverting is deleting the group.

---

### 7. `setHandleAudioBecomingNoisy(true)`

One line on the `ExoPlayer.Builder`, and the default is wrong for anything that
plays audio: without it, Bluetooth disconnecting or headphones being unplugged
leaves playback running out of the phone's speaker. Media3 handles the
`ACTION_AUDIO_BECOMING_NOISY` broadcast itself once it's set.

A tool cannot do this for itself — it needs a `BroadcastReceiver`, and
`android.content` is blocked.

### 8. `LightAudioPlayer.isCurrentItemSeekable`

Whether the stream that actually arrived can be seeked within — true for a file
or any response carrying a length and byte ranges, false for a live chunked
transcode. Media3 already knows; the SDK didn't pass it on.

Without it a tool has to infer seekability from the format it *asked* for, and
that is wrong precisely when a server declines to transcode. Ask Navidrome for
mp3 when the file is already mp3 and it sends the file untouched — then ignores
`timeOffset`, having no encode to offset. The tool seeks the only way it thinks
it can, the server ignores it, and the track silently restarts while the
position readout insists the seek landed.

### 9. `hasRuntimePermission(permission)` — `LightPermissions.kt`

Whether this process holds a permission, from the process itself. The SDK's
`checkPermission` asks the server, and the server answers from its own policy
before it looks at the grant — `BlockedByServer` where the tool isn't meant to
have it, `Unknown` where it can't say. What decides whether a file can be read
is the grant, which the user may have made in Android's own settings without
the server hearing of it. A tool with only the server's answer told such a
phone to allow access it already had, and sent it to a prompt with nothing to
change. Exposes `LightServiceConnection.applicationContext` (internal) to ask.

## Workarounds

Each of these is described in full — what it's standing in for, and how to
remove it — in [SDK-GAPS.md](SDK-GAPS.md). In brief:

### 10. `audio/LightMediaService.kt` + manifest

Foreground `MediaSessionService` so audio survives the screen going off.
Also declares `FOREGROUND_SERVICE` and `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MEDIA_PLAYBACK`.

### 11. `transfer/LightTransferService.kt` + manifest

`dataSync` foreground service so downloads aren't throttled ~9× when the tool is
backgrounded.

### 12. `LightActivity` — volume key pass-through

Lets hardware volume keys reach the system so the media session can route them,
which is what makes the rocker control a cast renderer rather than a silent
local player.

### 13. `display/LightDisplayColor.kt` + `LightActivity.onResume`/`onPause`

Switches LightOS's device-wide greyscale filter off while the tool is in front.
Needs `WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS`, declared in the `debug` and `release` manifest
overlays but never in `src/main` — the plugin validates `src/main` only, so it
cannot reach a submitted build.

### 14. `cast/DlnaCast.kt`

SSDP discovery and SOAP control, written by hand because the sandbox blocks the
libraries that would normally do this.

## Seeing them as a diff

**The markers are authoritative**, not the diff. If a change isn't marked
`SDK PATCH`, `SPIKE` or `TEMPORARY`, it isn't ours:

```bash
grep -rn "SDK PATCH\|SPIKE\|TEMPORARY" sdk/ tool/src
```

Upstream can be added as a remote, and the diff is worth reading — but it is
*not* the patch set:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/lightphone/light-sdk
git fetch upstream
git diff upstream/main -- sdk/
```

This repository was started with `git init` rather than forked, so it shares no
history with upstream and git has no merge base to work from. That diff is a raw
comparison of two unrelated trees: it shows our changes *and* everything Light
has done since this copy was taken, with no way to tell them apart. Files Light
has added since show up as deletions on our side. It gets less useful the longer
upstream runs ahead.

To see what upstream has that we don't, read the diff the other way round and
ignore anything carrying a marker.

## Before submitting a tool

The workarounds are the thing to remove. Each carries its own revert steps, and
this finds every one of them:

```bash
grep -rn "SPIKE\|TEMPORARY" sdk/ tool/src
```

The additions in §1–8 are a separate conversation with Light: they are useful to
any tool, not just this one, and are written to be upstreamable as they stand.
